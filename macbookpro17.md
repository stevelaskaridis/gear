##### Experience

Upgraded from mid-2015 Macbook to this generation due to screen artefacts on the previous laptop.

My experience so far:

* The **good** parts:
  - The screen is gorgeous. Retina got a substantial upgrade with very nice blacks and higher levels of brightness.
  - Performance is awesome. Silent under everyday tasks, without uncomfortably warm. The disk is very fast.
  - I enjoyed the addition of the fingerprint sensor, especially after configuring sudo to authenticate with it in the "/etc/pam.d/sudo".
  - The speakers have become even better than the previous generation.
* The **bad** parts:
  - The keyboard leaves a lot to be desired. Definitely need to by an accompanying can of compressed air to keep everything functional.
  - I could do without the touchbar. Sometimes it gets stuck to blank and have to restart.
  - Space gray start to fade on palmrest; have to address this with Apple.
  - The dongle life is ... the new reality.

Overall, I would say "meh", considering its price.
