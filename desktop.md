##### Experience

This is the machine I use at home. I bought most of the parts second hand and I am really satisfied with its immense performance and general reliability. The temps are relatively low too.

Caveats:

* I had a compatibility problem between the motherboard's SATA controller and any native installation of Linux (tested with Ubuntu 14.04, 14.10 and Fedora 20). This is the very reason I am currently running this machine with Windows.
