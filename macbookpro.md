* RAM: 16GB 1600MHz

##### Experience

This is my main machine. I take it everywhere and do most of my work on that.
So far, it's great working on such a machine.

Second thoughts: 
* Satisfactory battery life
* Expandability (room for two hard drives)
* Screen Resolution seems to be behind the competition.
* Had a problem with main SATA cable
