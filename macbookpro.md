##### Specs

* CPU: Intel Core i5 3210M 2.5GHz (Turbo Boost 3.2Ghz)
* RAM: 16Gb 1600MHz
* Hard Drive: Samsung 840 EVO 250Gb
* Screen: 13-inch, 1280*800

##### Experience

This is my main machine. I take it everywhere and do most of my work on that.
So far, it's great working on such a machine.

Second thoughts: 
* Satisfactory battery life
* Expandability (room for two hard drives)
* Screen Resolution is seems behind.
* Had a problem with main SATA cable
